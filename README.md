# Buy Alert Bot by Bzzman

## About Project
  ***Work in progress.*** This bot sends notifications to your Telegram to buy the coins you want. You need a Tradingview account to handle the webhooks. You can pick any indicator and change the settings as you wish. I chose an open source indicator("StochasticRSI & RSI & MACD") from Crypto_Adhyeta. This bot detects the alert, sends you "Buy" notifications via Telegram. This project is a simple version of my [latest project](https://github.com/eyupbarlas/Crypto-Trading-Bot-with-Tradingview-Binance-Heroku-and-Telegram). Feel free the check out!
